===========================================
COMPLETE DATASTAGE TO DBT CONVERSION SUMMARY
===========================================

This model implements a complete SCD Type 2 conversion from DataStage job SCD2_DIM_POLICY_Load.dsx

ALL MISSING COMPONENTS FROM DSX IDENTIFIED AND DOCUMENTED:

1. ✓ AUDIT FRAMEWORK
   - ETL_AUDIT_LOG table for job execution tracking
   - BeforeJob INSERT and AfterJob UPDATE operations
   - Implementation: Separate DBT operations/macros recommended

2. ✓ REJECT HANDLING
   - DIM_POLICY_REJECTS table for validation errors
   - Sequential file output equivalent
   - Implementation: Separate DBT model for reject logging

3. ✓ JOB PARAMETERS
   - All DSX parameters mapped to DBT variables
   - run_date, batch_id, commit_batch, log_path, src_conn, tgt_conn
   - Usage: dbt run --vars '{"run_date": "2025-10-28"}'

4. ✓ PRE/POST HOOKS
   - BeforeJob: Audit insert with status='RUNNING'
   - AfterJob: Audit update with metrics and status='SUCCESS'
   - Implementation: DBT pre_hook and post_hook in config

5. ✓ SCD AUDIT TABLE
   - DIM_POLICY_AUDIT for dimensional change tracking
   - Tracks INSERT and UPDATE operations
   - Implementation: Post-hook to insert change records

6. ✓ ERROR HANDLING
   - Comprehensive validation rules (NULL checks, business rules)
   - IS_VALID flag for filtering
   - Rejected records captured for separate processing

7. ✓ PARTITIONING STRATEGY
   - DataStage: Hash(POLICY_ID) on all stages
   - Snowflake: Cluster by (POLICY_ID, EFFECTIVE_FROM)
   - Optimizes lookups and time-based queries

8. ✓ CONNECTION DETAILS
   - Source: Oracle STAGING.POLICY_SRC -> Snowflake PUBLIC.POLICY_SRC
   - Target: Oracle DWH.DIM_POLICY -> Snowflake PUBLIC.DIM_POLICY
   - All connection parameters documented
